Lab Exercises - 2
Python Repetition
For Loops Exercises
1 - Write a programme that asks the user to enter their name and a number. If the number is less
than 1 0, then display their name that number times; otherwise, display the message “Too high”
three times.
2 – Set a variable called total to 0. Your programme should ask the user to enter five numbers and
after each input, ask them if they want that number to be included. If they do, the programme
should then add the number to the total. If they do not want it included, the programme shouldn’t
add the number to the total. After the user has entered all five numbers, display the total.
3 - Write a programme that asks which direction the user wants to count (up or down). If they select
up, then the programme should ask them for the top number and count from 1 to that number. If
the user selects down, the programme should ask them to enter a number below 2 0 and then count
down from 2 0 to that number. If the user entered something other than up or down, display the
message “I don’t understand”.
While Loop exercises
4 - Write a programme that asks the user to enter a number and then enter another number. The
programme should add these two numbers together and then ask if they want to add another
number. If the user enters “y”, the programme will ask them to enter another number and will keep
adding numbers until the user stops answering “y”. Once the loop has stopped, display the total.
5 – Create a variable called compnum and set the value to 5 0. Ask the user to enter a number. While
their guess is not the same as the compnum value, tell them if their guess is too high or too low and
ask them to have another guess. If they enter the same value as compnum, display the message
“Well done, you took [count] attempts”.
6 – Using the song “1 0 green bottles”, display the lines “There are [num] green bottles hanging on
the wall, [num] green bottle hanging on the wall, and is 1 green bottle should accidentally fall”. Then
ask the question “how many green bottles will be hanging on the wall?” If the user answers
correctly, display the message “There will be [num] green bottles hanging on the wall”. If they
answer incorrectly, display the message “No, try again” until they get it right. When the number of
green bottles gets down to 0, display the message “There are no more green bottles hanging on the
wall”.
Function Exercises
7 – Define a function that will ask the user to enter a number and save it as the variable “num”.
Define another function that will use “num” and count 1 to that number.
8 – Create a programme that will allow the user to easily manage a list of names. You should display
a menu that will allow them to add a name to the list, change the name in the list, delete a name
from the list from the list or view all the names in the list. There should be a menu option to allow

<!-- Page 2 -->
the user to end the programme. If they select an option that is not relevant, then it should display a
suitable message. After they have made a selection to either, add a name, change a name delete a
name or view all the names, they should see the menu again without having to restart the
programme. The programme should be as easy to use as possible.
Random Exercises
9 – Write a programme that displays a random fruit from a list of 5 fruits.
1 0 – Write a programme that randomly chooses either heads or tails (“h” or “t”). The programme
asks the user to make a choice. If their choice is the same as the randomly selected value, display the
message “You win”, otherwise display “Bad luck”. At the end, tell the user if the computer selected
heads or tails.
1 1 - Write a programme that randomly chooses a number between 1 and 5. The programme should
ask the user to pick a number. If they guess correctly, display the message “Well done”, otherwise
the programme should tell them if they are too high or too low and should ask them to pick a second
number. If they guess correctly on their second guess, display the message “Correct”, otherwise
display “You lose”.
1 2 – Write a programme that displays five colours and asks the user to pick one. If they pick the
same as the programme has chosen, say “Well done”, otherwise display a witty answer which
involves the correct colour, e.g. “I bet you are GREEN with envy” or “You are probably feeling BLUE
right now”. The programme should ask them to guess again; if the user has still not got it right, it
keeps giving them the same clue and it asks the user to enter a colour until they guess it correctly.
Turtle Graphics exercises
1 3 - Draw a circle.
1 4 - Draw an octagon that uses a different colour (randomly selected from a list of six possible
colours) for each line.
1 5 - Draw a pattern that will change each time the programme is run. Use random function to pick
the number of lines, the length of each line and the angle of each turn.
Data structure – List Exercise
1 6 - Create a list of four three-digit numbers. Display the list to the user, showing each item from the
list on a separate line. Ask the user to enter a three-digit number. If the number they have typed in
matches one in the list, display the position of that number in the list otherwise display the message
“That’s not in the list”.
1 7 - Write a programme that asks the user to enter the names of three people they want to invite to
a party and store them in a list. After they have entered all three names, ask them if they want to
add another. If they do, allow them to add more names until they say “no”. When they say “no”,
display how many people they have invited to the party.

Data structure – Dictionary Exercises
1 8 - Create a programme that asks the user to enter four of their favourite foods and store them in a
dictionary so that they are associated with keys starting from 1. Display the dictionary in full,
showing the key-value pairs. The programme should ask the user which key-value pair they want to
get rid of and remove it from the dictionary. Finally, the programme should sort the remaining data
and display the dictionary.
Data structure – tuple exercises
1 9 - Create a tuple containing the names of five countries and display the whole tuple. Ask the user
to enter one of the countries that have been shown to them and then display the index number (i.e.
position in the list) of that item in the tuple.
Next, the programme should ask the user to enter a number (index) and display the country in that
position.
Numeric Arrays
2 0 – Write a programme that asks the user for a list of five integers. Store them in an array. Sort the
list and displays it in reverse order.
2 1 – Create an array which will store a list of integers. Generate five random numbers and store
them in the array. Display the array (showing each item on a separate line).
2 2 – Create two arrays (one containing three numbers that the user enters and one containing a set
of five random numbers). Join these two arrays together into one large array. Sort this large array
and display it so that each number appears on a separate line.
2 3 – Ask the user to enter five numbers. Sort them in order and present them to the user. Ask them
to select one of the numbers. Remove it from the original array and save it in a new array.
2 4 – Display and array of five numbers. Ask the user to select one of the numbers. Once they have
selected a number, display the position of that number in the array. If they enter something that is
not in the array, ask them to try again until they select a relevant number.
2 5 – Create an array of five numbers between 1 0 and 1 0 0 which each have two decimal places. Ask
the user to enter a whole number between 2 and 5. If they enter something outside of that range,
display a suitable error message and ask them again to try until they enter a valid number. Divide
each of the numbers in the array by the number entered and display the answers shown to two
decimal places.
### 2 D Lists and Dictionaries
2 6 – Create the following using a simple 2 D list and ask the user to select a row and a column and
display that value.

<!-- Page 4 -->
0 1 2
0 2 5 8
1 3 7 4
2 1 6 9
3 4 2 0
2 7 - Using the 2 D list in the previous exercise, ask the user which row they would like displayed and
display just that row. Ask them to enter a new value and add it to the end of the row and display row
again.
2 8 – Change the previous programme to ask the user which row they want displayed. Display that
row. Ask the user which column in that row they want displayed and display the value in held in
there. Ask the user if they want to change the value and change the data. Finally, display the whole
row again.
2 9 – Ask the user to enter the name age and show size for the four people in a list and display the
names and ages of all the people in the list but do not show their show size.
3 0 – After gathering the four names, ages and shoe sizes, ask the user to enter the name of the
person they want to remove from the list. Delete this row from the data and display the other rows
on separate lines.
